<h1>Labor Market</h1>
<p>Recall IS-LM model, there are several pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No labor market in IS-LM model (only goods market and financial market). <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/us-weekly-jobless-claims.html">Job Report from Dept. of Labor</a></p></li>
<li><p>No too much discussion on general price level or inflation. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/consumer-price-index-increases-5point4percent-in-june-vs-5percent-estimate.html">Monthly Inflation</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, unemployment, wage and inflation play key roles in modern economy, especially for policy-makers. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/the-upside-to-inflation-rising-wages.html">Wage vs Inflation</a></p>

<h1>Labor Market</h1>
<p>Let’s extend our analysis from short run to medium run, and start from labor market:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Workers are typically paid a wage that exceeds their <strong>reservation wage</strong>, the wage that would make them indifferent between working or being unemployed.</p></li>
<li><p>Wages typically depend on labor market conditions. The lower the unemployment rate, the higher the wages.</p></li>
<li><p>Bargaining power:</p></li>
<li><p>How much bargaining power a worker has depends first on the nature of the job. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/teamsters-to-vote-thursday-on-sweeping-push-to-unionize-amazon-workers.html">Unionize Amazon Workers</a></p></li>
<li><p>How much bargaining power a worker has also depends on <strong>labor market condition</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the unemployment rate is low, it is more difficult for firms to find qualified replacement workers. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-restaurants-hospitality-temporarily-close-food-work-jobs-employment-2021-7">Labor Shortage</a></p></li>
<li><p>When the unemployment rate is high, finding another job is harder for workers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Economists call the theories that link <em>productivity</em> and <em>efficiency</em> of workers to the wage as <strong>efficiency wage theories</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firms - such as high-tech firms - that see employee morale and commitment as essential to the quality of their work will pay more than firms in sectors where workers’ activities are more routine. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Texas-A-and-M-University-Salaries-E1077312.htm">Glassdoor</a></li>
</ul></li>

<h1>Wages Determination</h1>
<p>We capture our discussion of wage determination by using the following equation: <span class="math inline">\(W=P\cdot F\underset{(-, +)}{(u, z)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Alternative, we can rearrange the wage determination equation to see real wage: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{W}{P}=F\underset{(-, +)}{(u, z)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The aggregate nominal wage <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> depends on three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The price level <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Neither firms nor Workers care about nominal wages <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, they care about real wage <span class="math inline">\(\frac{W}{P}\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The unemployment rate, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher the unemployment rate <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, the lower the real wage <span class="math inline">\(\frac{W}{P}\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A catchall variable, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, that stands for all other variables that may affect the outcome of wage setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment benefit <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/delta-variant-may-fuel-push-to-extend-unemployment-pay-experts-say.html">One more year?</a></li>
</ul></li>

<div id="price-determination" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Price Determination</h1>
<p>The prices set by firms depend on the costs they face (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(economics)">Economic Profit</a>). These costs depend on the nature of the <strong>production function</strong>: <span class="math display">\[
Y=A\cdot N
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is output, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is employment and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is labor productivity. In this simplied production function, we ignore capital (e.g. machines and factories) for a while. We also ignore technological progress and assume <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is constant.</p>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(Y=N\)</span>. This is equivalent to assume one unit of labor produces one unit of goods.</p>
<p>Since labor cost per unit is wage <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, sales revenue per unit is price <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (In microeconomics: marginal cost of production - the cost of producing one more unit of output - is equal to <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perfect competition on goods market: <span class="math inline">\(P=W\)</span> (marginal revenue equals to marginal cost).</p></li>
<li><p>General case: <span class="math inline">\(P=(1+\mu)W\)</span> (marginal revenue equals to marginal cost (<span class="math inline">\(\mu=0\)</span>, e.g. perfect competition) greater than marginal cost (<span class="math inline">\(\mu&gt;0\)</span>, e.g. market power)).</p>
<ul>
<li>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the <strong>mark-up</strong> of the price over the cost. It captures economic profit for firms. The higher the degree of competition (the lower the market power of firms), the lower the <strong>mark-up</strong>. The lower the degree of competition (the higher the market power of firms), the higher the <strong>mark-up</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, we can rearrange price determination equation to see real price: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{P}{W}=1+\mu\)</span>.</p>
