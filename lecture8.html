<h1>Labor Market</h1>
<p>Recall IS-LM model, there are several pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No labor market in IS-LM model (only goods market and financial market). <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/us-weekly-jobless-claims.html">Job Report from Dept. of Labor</a></p></li>
<li><p>No too much discussion on general price level or inflation. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/consumer-price-index-increases-5point4percent-in-june-vs-5percent-estimate.html">Monthly Inflation</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, unemployment, wage and inflation play key roles in modern economy, especially for policy-makers. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/the-upside-to-inflation-rising-wages.html">Wage vs Inflation</a></p>

<h1>Labor Market</h1>
<p>Let’s extend our analysis from short run to medium run, and start from labor market:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Workers are typically paid a wage that exceeds their <strong>reservation wage</strong>, the wage that would make them indifferent between working or being unemployed.</p></li>
<li><p>Wages typically depend on labor market conditions. The lower the unemployment rate, the higher the wages.</p></li>
<li><p>Bargaining power:</p></li>
<li><p>How much bargaining power a worker has depends first on the nature of the job. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/teamsters-to-vote-thursday-on-sweeping-push-to-unionize-amazon-workers.html">Unionize Amazon Workers</a></p></li>
<li><p>How much bargaining power a worker has also depends on <strong>labor market condition</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the unemployment rate is low, it is more difficult for firms to find qualified replacement workers. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-restaurants-hospitality-temporarily-close-food-work-jobs-employment-2021-7">Labor Shortage</a></p></li>
<li><p>When the unemployment rate is high, finding another job is harder for workers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Economists call the theories that link <em>productivity</em> and <em>efficiency</em> of workers to the wage as <strong>efficiency wage theories</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firms - such as high-tech firms - that see employee morale and commitment as essential to the quality of their work will pay more than firms in sectors where workers’ activities are more routine. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Texas-A-and-M-University-Salaries-E1077312.htm">Glassdoor</a></li>
</ul></li>
